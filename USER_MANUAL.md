### Managing Sensor Settings

**Advanced Sensor Configuration:**

Each sensor can be configured with detailed settings via the dashboard. Click the Settings icon (sliders 🎚️) next to any sensor to access the sensor settings modal.

**Available Settings:**

1. **Sensor Location**
   - Physical location or network segment description
   - Examples: "Office VLAN 10", "DMZ Gateway", "Branch Office Amsterdam"
   - Helps identify which part of your network the sensor monitors
   - Shows in dashboard for quick reference

2. **Internal Networks**
   - Define your internal network CIDR ranges
   - One range per line
   - Examples:
     ```
     10.0.0.0/8
     172.16.0.0/12
     192.168.0.0/16
     ```
   - Used for detection logic (internal vs external traffic)
   - Helps identify lateral movement and internal scanning

3. **Heartbeat Interval**
   - How often the sensor sends heartbeat signals to SOC
   - Range: 10-300 seconds
   - Default: 30 seconds
   - Lower = faster offline detection, higher network overhead
   - Higher = less network traffic, slower offline detection

4. **Config Sync Interval**
   - How often sensor checks for configuration updates
   - Range: 60-3600 seconds (1 minute to 1 hour)
   - Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
   - Lower = faster config updates, more database queries
   - Higher = less overhead, slower config propagation

**How to Configure:**

1. Navigate to **Sensors Tab**
2. Click the **Settings** icon (🎚️) next to the sensor
3. Sensor settings modal opens
4. Edit the desired settings:
   - Update location description
   - Add/modify internal network ranges
   - Adjust heartbeat interval
   - Adjust config sync interval
5. Click **"Save Settings"**
6. Settings are saved to central database
7. Sensor automatically picks up changes within the sync interval
8. For immediate application: use the Update or Reboot button

**Important Notes:**
- All settings are stored centrally in the SOC database
- Sensors automatically synchronize settings at their configured interval
- No need to manually edit sensor.conf files
- Changes apply to the specific sensor only (not global)
- Always test settings changes on one sensor before rolling out to all

### Monitoring Sensor Health

**Green Status**: Sensor is healthy
- Sending metrics regularly
- No performance issues
- Last seen < 2 minutes ago

**Red Status**: Sensor has issues
- No communication for > 5 minutes
- High CPU/RAM usage

## Configuration

### Centralized Configuration Management

**Modern Approach:**

NetMonitor SOC uses a centralized configuration system. All sensor settings (except basic connection parameters) are managed through the dashboard and synchronized automatically.

**Sensor-Side Configuration (sensor.conf):**

Sensors only need minimal local configuration:
```ini
INTERFACE=eth0
SOC_SERVER_URL=http://soc.example.com:8080
SSL_VERIFY=true
SENSOR_SECRET_KEY=optional-secret-key
```

**Centrally Managed Settings:**
- Sensor location and description
- Internal network ranges (CIDR)
- Detection rule thresholds
- Heartbeat and sync intervals
- Alert severity levels
- Custom detection parameters

**How It Works:**
1. Configure settings via dashboard (Sensors → Settings or Configuration tab)
2. Settings stored in SOC database
3. Sensors poll for updates at configured sync interval (default: 5 minutes)
4. Sensors automatically apply new settings
5. No manual file editing required on sensor systems

**Benefits:**
- Consistent configuration across all sensors
- Easy bulk updates
- Version control and audit trail
- No need to SSH into sensor systems
- Per-sensor customization when needed

### Detection Rules

**Configuration → Detection Rules Tab**

**Available Rules:**
1. Port Scan Detection
2. Brute Force Detection
3. DNS Tunneling Detection
4. Large File Transfer Detection
5. DDoS Detection
6. Unusual Port Activity
7. Internal Scanning
8. Protocol Anomaly Detection
9. Beacon Detection
10. Data Exfiltration Detection
11. Malware Communication Detection
12. Lateral Movement Detection
13. Suspicious DNS Detection

**For Each Rule:**
- ☑️ Enable/Disable checkbox
- 📊 Threshold values
- 📝 Description and purpose
- 🌍 Scope: Global or per-sensor

### Adjusting Thresholds

**Example: Port Scan Detection**

```
Threshold: Number of unique ports before alert
Default: 10 ports
Too many alerts: Increase to 20-30
Missing scans: Decrease to 5-10
```

**Example: Brute Force Detection**

```
Threshold: Failed attempts before alert
Default: 5 attempts
Strong security: 3 attempts
Reduce noise: 10 attempts
```

### Configuration Workflow

1. **Navigate to Configuration tab**
2. **Select category** (Detection Rules / Thresholds / etc.)
3. **Adjust values** in the form
4. **Choose scope**:
   - Global: Applies to all sensors
   - Sensor-specific: Override for one sensor
5. **Click "Save Changes"**
6. **Wait for sync** (sensors update within 5 minutes)
7. **Force immediate**: Restart sensor

### Resetting Configuration

**Reset to Defaults:**
- Click "Reset to Best Practice Defaults"
- Confirms destructive action
- Reverts all settings to recommended values
- Use when configuration is misconfigured

## Whitelist Management

### Why Whitelist?

Prevent false positives from:
- Internal servers
- Trusted external services
- Backup systems
- Monitoring tools
- Admin workstations

### Adding Whitelist Entries

**Whitelist Tab → Add Entry**

**Single IP:**
```
IP/CIDR: 192.168.1.50
Description: Admin workstation
Scope: Global
```

**IP Range (CIDR):**
```
IP/CIDR: 10.0.0.0/8
Description: Internal network
Scope: Global
```

**Per-Sensor Whitelist:**
```
IP/CIDR: 203.0.113.100
Description: External backup server
Scope: Sensor-specific
Sensor: office-vlan10-01
```

### Managing Whitelist

**View Entries:**
- Global whitelist (applies to all)
- Sensor-specific entries
- Shows IP, description, scope

**Remove Entry:**
- Click delete button
- Confirms action
- Sensor picks up within 5 minutes

## AI Integration (MCP Server)

### Overview

NetMonitor SOC includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants like Claude to monitor and interact with your SOC platform through a modern HTTP API.

**What is MCP?**

MCP is a standardized protocol that allows AI assistants to access external systems securely. The NetMonitor MCP server exposes your SOC data and operations to AI tools while maintaining security and access control.

**What Can AI Do?**

- **Threat Analysis**: "Claude, analyze the last 24 hours of critical alerts and identify patterns"
- **Incident Response**: "What are the top 3 priority incidents I should handle first?"
- **Security Queries**: "Show me all port scan alerts from external sources this week"
- **Operational Insights**: "Which sensors have performance issues?"
- **Custom Reports**: "Generate a summary of all brute force attempts by source country"

**For SOC Operators:**

You typically don't need to interact with the MCP server directly - it's designed for administrators who want to integrate AI capabilities. However, if you're interested in using an AI assistant to help monitor your SOC:

1. Ask your administrator to create a **read_only** API token for you
2. Connect Claude or another AI assistant using the token
3. Ask questions in natural language about your security posture
4. Get AI-powered analysis and recommendations

**Example Workflow:**

```
You: "Claude, show me the sensors that are offline"
Claude: *queries MCP server*
        "Currently 2 sensors are offline:
        - office-vlan10-01 (last seen 15 minutes ago)
        - branch-dmz-03 (last seen 2 hours ago)"

You: "Analyze the recent DDoS alerts"
Claude: *retrieves and analyzes alerts*
        "I found 5 DDoS alerts in the past 6 hours, all targeting
        10.0.0.50. Pattern suggests volumetric attack.
        Recommendation: Enable rate limiting and contact ISP."
```

**Security Note:**

All MCP access is authenticated and logged. Your administrator controls what permissions each token has (read-only vs full access). AI assistants can only see data you have access to.

**Learn More:**

If you want to set up AI integration, refer to the [ADMIN_MANUAL.md](ADMIN_MANUAL.md) MCP Server section or contact your administrator.

Alert: Port Scan Detected
Source: 192.168.1.100
Ports: 22, 23, 80, 443, 3306, 3389, 8080
```

**2. Identify Source:**
- Is it internal or external?
- Known IP? Check inventory
- Hostname available?

**3. Determine Intent:**
- **Legitimate**: Admin tool, vulnerability scanner
  → Add to whitelist
- **Malicious**: Unauthorized scanning
  → Block IP, investigate system
- **Compromised**: Internal system infected
  → Isolate system, run antivirus

**4. Take Action:**
- Whitelist if legitimate
- Block and monitor if suspicious
- Incident response if compromised

### Adding a New Sensor

**1. Prepare Sensor:**
- Linux machine with network access
- Mirror port or in-line deployment
- SSH access

**2. Deploy:**
```bash
# On sensor machine
scp -r netmonitor/ user@sensor:/tmp/
ssh user@sensor
cd /tmp/netmonitor
sudo ./setup_sensor.sh
```

**3. Verify:**
- Check Sensors tab in dashboard
- Sensor appears as Online
- Metrics updating

**4. Configure:**
- Click Settings button
- Set location
- Configure internal networks
- Adjust heartbeat/sync intervals if needed

---

## Best Practices

### Alert Management

**Do:**
- ✅ Review alerts daily
- ✅ Investigate unknowns immediately
- ✅ Keep whitelist up to date
- ✅ Document your decisions
- ✅ Track false positive patterns

**Don't:**
- ❌ Ignore low-severity alerts completely
- ❌ Disable rules without understanding
- ❌ Over-whitelist (defeats purpose)
- ❌ Forget to acknowledge reviewed alerts

### Configuration

**Do:**
- ✅ Start with defaults
- ✅ Adjust gradually based on experience
- ✅ Document changes
- ✅ Test in development first
- ✅ Use sensor-specific overrides when needed

**Don't:**
- ❌ Set thresholds too high (miss threats)
- ❌ Set thresholds too low (alert fatigue)
- ❌ Change multiple settings at once
- ❌ Disable all detection rules

### Sensor Management

**Do:**
- ✅ Deploy sensors strategically
- ✅ Monitor sensor health
- ✅ Keep sensors updated
- ✅ Use descriptive names/locations
- ✅ Document sensor placements

**Don't:**
- ❌ Deploy sensors without planning
- ❌ Ignore offline sensors
- ❌ Mix sensor versions significantly
- ❌ Overload sensors with traffic

### Sensor Configuration

**Do:**
- ✅ Use dashboard to adjust sensor settings (not manual sensor.conf editing)
- ✅ Always configure location and internal networks via dashboard
- ✅ Test configuration changes on one sensor first before rolling out to all
- ✅ Monitor sensor status after config changes
- ✅ Document why you made specific configuration choices
- ✅ Use appropriate heartbeat intervals (default 30s is good for most)
- ✅ Keep config sync interval at default (300s) unless you have specific needs

**Don't:**
- ❌ Manually edit sensor.conf files on sensor systems (except initial setup)
- ❌ Set heartbeat interval too low (< 15s causes unnecessary overhead)
- ❌ Set config sync interval too high (> 600s delays important updates)
- ❌ Copy sensor.conf between different sensors (each needs unique ID)
- ❌ Change multiple sensor settings simultaneously without testing
- ❌ Forget to define internal networks (critical for accurate detection)

### Account Security

**Do:**
- ✅ Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for your account
- ✅ Use a strong, unique password (12+ characters)
- ✅ Save your 2FA backup codes in a safe place
- ✅ Log out when you're done (User menu → Logout)
- ✅ Change your password if you suspect it's compromised
- ✅ Keep your authenticator app updated
- ✅ Report suspicious activity to your administrator

**Don't:**
- ❌ Share your password with anyone
- ❌ Use the same password for multiple accounts
- ❌ Leave your session logged in on shared computers
- ❌ Disable 2FA without admin approval
- ❌ Screenshot or write down your password
- ❌ Use simple passwords like "Password123"
- ❌ Lose your 2FA backup codes (you'll be locked out!)

**If You Lose Access:**
- Contact your administrator immediately
- They can reset your 2FA (after verifying your identity)
- You'll need to set up 2FA again with a new QR code

**Session Security:**
- Your session expires after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Always log out on shared computers
- If you see unusual activity in your account, report it immediately
